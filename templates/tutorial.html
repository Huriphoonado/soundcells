                <p>Soundcells uses a text-based notation called abc. Musical scores notated in abc contain two main parts, the header and the notes.</p>

                <h5>Header</h5>
                <p>A header, also called metadata, provides information about an entire piece of music or an excerpt that follows it. Every field must be on its own line and must contain a capital letter followed by a colon and a value. For example, the following is a minimal header:</p>
                <pre><code>X: 1
M: 4/4
K: Bb</code></pre>
                <p>Above, <code>X</code> provides a tune number, <code>M</code> indicates a time signature of four-over-four while <code>K</code> sets a key signature of Bb.</p>
                <p>Optionally, you might want to set a composer with <code>C</code>, a title with <code>T</code>, or a default note length with <code>L</code>.</p>
                <p>You can have multiple header groups in a score, but don't stick one in the middle of a measure!</p>

                <h5>Music: Notes, Rests, and Barlines</h5>
                <p>Notes are added by typing a letter from <code>aâ€“g</code>. Lowercase letters are an octave higher than uppercase letters, octave 5 and octave 4 respectively.</p>
                <p>Typed before the pitch: underscores (<code>_</code>) and carets (<code>^</code>) flatten and sharpen it, while an equal sign (<code>=</code>) makes it natural.</p>
                <p>Typed after the pitch: numbers and fractions multiply its base duration (specified by header <code>L</code>). Apostrophes (<code>'</code>) and commas (<code>,</code>) raise or lower the octave. Soundcells plays the note back anytime you type one of these characters, so play around!</p>
                <p>Rests are the letter <code>z</code> and may be followed by a duration.</p>
                <p>Finally, you can notate barlines by typing a vertical line or a pipe <code>|</code> with <kbd>shift + \</kbd>. As you might guess, two vertical lines is a double bar <code>||</code> while a vertical line followed by a right square bracket is an ending double bar <code>|]</code>.</p>
